Now, I'am looking forward to applying the same principles to designing prototypes and products that will be aesthetically appealing to the users. My experience as a designer has given me the deswire to create seamless design and interaction strategies for mobile, web, desktop, and other hardware end point, and i am looking for a full-time role that offers a similar opportuinity.
